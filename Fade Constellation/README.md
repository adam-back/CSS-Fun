Draw Stars
1. Open Photoshop and start a new project with a black background, measuring 500 x 500 px. Make it invisible by clicking the eye to hide it.
2. Create a new layer (should be transparent), then use a brush and black paint to draft the constellation.
3. Create a new layer. Use a circular brush with 95% hardness. Alternate the size of the brush and colors. Add dots over the guide stars. 
4. Make the black background visible. Delete the draft layer.
5. Select the Crosshatch 1 brush. Alter the size and color to match the individual stars.
