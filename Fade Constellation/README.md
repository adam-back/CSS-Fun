##Draw Stars
1. Open Photoshop and start a new project with a black background, measuring 500x500px. Make it invisible by clicking the eye to hide it.
2. Create a new layer (should be transparent), then use a brush and black paint to draft the constellation.
3. Create a new layer. Use a circular brush with 95% hardness. Alternate the size of the brush and colors. Add dots over the draft stars. 
4. Delete the draft layer. Make the black background visible. 
5. Select the Crosshatch 1 brush. Alter the size and color to match the individual stars.

##Draw Lines
1. Select the line tool. Set its fill to the line color (#98a9dd). Stroke doesn't matter, because it's set at `0pt`. Set weight to `2px`.
2. Create a new layer. Start drawing lines on it.
3. Select all of the Shape layers and `Merge Shapes`.
4. With that layer still selected, `Filter > Blur > Blur More`.

##Save Files
1. Hide everything but the stars.
1. `Cmd-Opt-Shift-S`. Save as 500x500px `png` with transparent background. Name something like, `shape_stars.png`.
1. Hide everything but the lines.
1. Save the same way as above, but with `shape_lines.png`.
